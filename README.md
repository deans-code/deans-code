## Hi, I'm Dean 👋

I have been developing software professionally since graduating from University in 2006. Most recently I have been employed as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect, leading development teams in the delivery of software solutions incorporating various .NET based Digital Experience Platforms and Content Management Systems. 

I am interested in all aspects of technology, from retro computing to AI.

## Highlighted repositories

Some technologies I have been exploring:

## In the works

Some projects I have in the pipeline:

| Category | Repository | Description |
