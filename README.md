## Hi, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing software professionally for more than 19 years. Most recently I have been employed as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect, leading development teams in the delivery of software solutions incorporating various .NET based Digital Experience Platforms and Content Management Systems. 

I am interested in all aspects of technology, from retro computing to AI.
