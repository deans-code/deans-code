## Hi, I'm Dean 👋

I have been developing software professionally since graduating from University in 2006. Most recently I have been employed as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect, leading development teams in the delivery of web based software solutions. 

I am interested in all aspects of technology, from retro computing to AI.
