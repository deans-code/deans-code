## Hi, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing software professionally for more than 19 years. Most recently I have been employed as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect, leading development teams in the delivery of software solutions incorporating various .NET based Digital Experience Platforms and Content Management Systems. 

This account manages my personal projects; my goal for the projects hosted here is to broaden my knowledge and skill set by exploring technologies I do not encounter during my day-to-day work. I would also like to explore the benefits of hosting open-source code and contribute to the community, where possible.

I am interested in all aspects of technology from retro computing through to the modern day. I aim to reflect my broad interest in the projects I undertake in my free time.

## Some technologies I have been exploring...
