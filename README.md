## Hi, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing software professionally for digital agencies for more than 19 years, most recently working as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect delivering solutions across several .NET based web platforms.

This account manages my personal projects; my goal for the projects hosted here is to broaden my knowledge and skill-set by exploring technologies I do not encounter during my day-to-day work. I would also like to explore the benefits of hosting open-source code.

I am interested in all aspects of technology, from retro computing through to the modern day. I aim to reflect my broad interest in the projects I undertake in my free time.

Some technologies I have been exploring:

### :watch: Wearables

A [watchface](https://github.com/deans-code/rotation) for the [Pebble](https://repebble.com/) line of smart watches.

### :video_game: Gaming

A [simple prototype game](https://github.com/deans-code/barrel-and-crank) for the [Playdate](https://play.date/).

### :crystal_ball: AI
