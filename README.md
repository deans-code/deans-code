## Hi, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹

I develop web applications for a living, outside of work I enjoy exploring a broader set of technologies. This account manages my personal projects which currently focus on technologies outside of the web.

Some technologies I have been playing with:

### :watch: Wearables

A [watchface](https://github.com/deans-code/rotation) for the Pebble line of smart watches.

### :video_game: Gaming

A [simple prototype game](https://github.com/deans-code/barrel-and-crank) for the Playdate.

### :crystal_ball: AI

Local LLM working with [custom MCP tools](https://github.com/deans-code/pindex).
