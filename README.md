## Hi, I'm Dean 👋

I have been developing software professionally since graduating from University in 2006. Most recently I have been employed as a Lead Technical Developer and Solutions Architect, leading development teams in the delivery of software solutions incorporating various .NET based Digital Experience Platforms and Content Management Systems. 

I am interested in all aspects of technology, from retro computing to AI.

### Some technologies I have been exploring, useful in my day-to-day work...
